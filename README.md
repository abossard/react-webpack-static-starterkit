# React Webpack Static Starterkit FTW!!!!

> Another static website starter kit powered by [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and maybe a bit less versatile than [React-Static-Boilerplate](https://github.com/koistya/react-static-boilerplate)

What if I told you React can not only be used Client-side, but also Server-side. And what if I added, that you can generate plain boring HTML files out of it, that can be served by any webserver.
Would you believe it?

Okay, I'm honest, this is more of a playground for me to investigate how to make a static site generator with simple react things.

### Features

&nbsp; &nbsp; ✓ small, only around 200 lines<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ✓ server side react rendering<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ✓ not ready for prime time :-) <br>

### Getting Started

Just clone the repo, install Node.js modules and run `npm start`:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/abossard/react-webpack-static-starterkit
$ cd react-webpack-static-starterkit
$ npm install           # Install project dependencies listed in package.json
$ npm start             # Build and launch the app, same as "node tools/start.js"
```
